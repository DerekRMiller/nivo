    A network component connecting nodes with links.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveNetwork`.

    Please note that you can also use the `useNetwork` React hook if you want
    to handle the rendering by yourself, it accepts an object with almost
    the same props as the component and returns computed nodes & links.

    A variation around the [Network](self:/network/) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveNetworkCanvas`.

    to handle the rendering by yourself, it accepts an object with almost
